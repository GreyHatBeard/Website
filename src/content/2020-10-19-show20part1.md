This week we learn how saying no means that you can actually say yes more often, adding more control to what you do and being more productive with it. We chat about trying not to over commit and work out when you can work most effectively.

But first we cover the latest news with Microsoft's analysis on wellbeing in an era of Covid19, the latest from Zoom and some small but useful updates in the world of SharePoint.
