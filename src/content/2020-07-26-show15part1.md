Never let it be said that we turn down a challenge. We were asked by a listener to try and summarise Power Platform licensing and rather than just share what we knew, we managed to bring in one of the Microsoft experts on the subject, the very tattoed and always entertaining Chris Huntingford. Then, by sheer chance, Microsoft decided to drop the bombshell news of Dataflex and we had even more to chat about.

However, that is all for part two. In this part of the show, Al and I cover the latest news, especially all the updates from Microsoft Inspire and Ready 2020.
