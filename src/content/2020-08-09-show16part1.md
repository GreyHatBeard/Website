Have you been using lockdown and the extra time at home during the pandemic to try and pass some Microsoft Certifications? Or perhaps you are just interested in how you can better implement Security and Compliance in Microsoft 365? We were joined by Peter Rising this week as Al and Garry ran the show while Kevin sweltered in a tent on the Isle of Wight.

First up was the news including several updates on what is happening with Microsoft Teams and Microsoft proving Pink Floyd wrong with more education updates.
