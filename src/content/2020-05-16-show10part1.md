The first rule of Book Club is that you MUST talk about Book Club. The second rule is that audiobooks are ok too. This week we talk about our favourite books that have steered our thoughts in our careers. Before that though, we share our the news and our thoughts on two big topics for the week, the Microsoft Business Application Summit (MBAS) and Github Satellite.

Also, some news on a great result in the MBAS hackathon we mentioned last time

Part 1 focuses on the news and what we've been up to.
