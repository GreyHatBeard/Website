We're back for more! This week we decided to split the show in to four smaller, easier to digest parts for all you busy people on the move. The running topic this week was the hugely exciting subject that is Project Cortex and all that it will be able to offer.

The four parts are:

- Part 1 - News and what's front of mind for the Grey, the Hat and The Beard
- Part 2 - How will end users use Cortex?
- Part 3 - How will Cortex make metadata different?
- Part 4 - What problems will Cortex solve?
