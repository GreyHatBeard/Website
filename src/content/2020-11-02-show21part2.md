Telling Stories - more than just a great album by the Charlatans, it is a way to share the benefits of tools like those in the Power Platform. This week we are joined by Clarissa Gillingham as she shares her experience of forming great stories and some great tips for creating your own.

If you would like to appear on the show, please drop us a line using the form at https://www.greyhatbeard.com/upcoming-shows. We’d love to hear from everyone, especially if you’re not an MVP and would like to be heard more in the community.

We covered:

- Why telling stories helps
  - Relatability 
  - Turn something abstract into something understandable – a journey 
- How to tell stories well 
  - Focus on the people 
  - Analogies 
  - Formulate a journey 
- Sharing stories
  - User stories drive functionality
  - Power BI is visual storytelling
