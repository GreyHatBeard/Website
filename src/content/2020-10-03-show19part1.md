Ignite was on fire last week so we dedicated the show to our thoughts on the main news that came out. Was it the Power Apps in Teams news that caught your attention, perhaps Project Nucleus or even the updates to Logic Apps?  We cover what was announced and how we think you will be able to make use of these.
