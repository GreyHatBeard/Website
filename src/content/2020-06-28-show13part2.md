Bono may still not have found what he is looking for but this week we talk about Microsoft Search and how you can help people to find what they are looking for, well, as long as it is a document, page or other bit of content. We cover three key topics:
- What is Microsoft Search?
- Other search in Microsoft 365 like Teams
- How are they better together?
