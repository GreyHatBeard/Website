It's a CPS bonus this week as Iain Smith (Office Apps and Services MVP and Head of Professional Services at CPS) joins us to talk about Unified Comms. We should have been on best behaviour but that doesn't suit us on a Saturday morning! We cover three key topics:
- What is Collab and Unified Comms?
- What tools do you need for both?
- How are they better together?
