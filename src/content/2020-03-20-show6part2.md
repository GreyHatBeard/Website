Bucking the trend, we have decided to go Corona Lite in this episode and try and provide a distraction to the talk of remote working and certain viruses that are filling our newsfeeds. Instead, we'll be talking about Contributing to Open Source.

Contributing to Open Source

Three topics:

- How others do - an insiders view of maintaining an open source repo from Garry and how you can be a good contributor
