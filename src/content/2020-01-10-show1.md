Our first show! We introduce the podcast and ourselves before going to chat a little about what we've been up to as well as the news we've been keeping an eye on.

After a little roundabout chat on the news, we moved on to our thoughts for 2020 based on what we'd seen at ESPC and Ignite, covering Project Cortex, Microsoft Search, Bots and others.

Then we wrapped up with our tips for everyone for the year ahead.
