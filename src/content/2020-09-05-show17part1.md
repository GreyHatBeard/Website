After almost two months, the three of us are back together and ready to share the latest info and our thoughts to you all. This week, we think about how you can stay in contact with the latest information, discuss the Microsoft 365 roadmap and our thoughts and wishes for what will be announced at Ignite 2020.

First up was the news including why you should backup your Teams chat, the end of IE11, opensource at Microsoft and supporting a campaign against toxic male behaviour on Twitter.
