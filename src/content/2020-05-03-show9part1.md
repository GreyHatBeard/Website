I like that but can it look a bit less like SharePoint? Have you ever heard that said by someone? You might even have agreed. We talk about how true that thought is and if it needs to be done, what are the best ways to do it if you really do have to.

This week we also have a special guest joining us so big thanks to [Matt Weston](https://twitter.com/MattWeston365) for giving us his time and thoughts on SharePoint.

Also this week, you may notice our new logos courtesy of [Iain Smith's](https://twitter.com/NorthernUC) very talented daughter - what do you think?

Part 1 focuses on the news and what we've been up to.
