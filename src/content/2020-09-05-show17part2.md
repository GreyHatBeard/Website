After almost two months, the three of us are back together and ready to share the latest info and our thoughts to you all. This week, we think about how you can stay in contact with the latest information, discuss the Microsoft 365 roadmap and our thoughts and wishes for what will be announced at Ignite 2020.

We aimed to cover:
- How keep up with what is changing in M365?
- How do you know when the changes will happen?
- What do we think is coming for Ignite?
- What do we hope is coming?
