Bucking the trend, we have decided to go Corona Lite in this episode and try and provide a distraction to the talk of remote working and certain viruses that are filling our newsfeeds. Instead, we'll be talking about Contributing to Open Source.

Part 1 focuses on the news and what we've been up to.
