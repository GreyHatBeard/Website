It's a CPS bonus this week as Iain Smith (Office Apps and Services MVP and Head of Professional Services at CPS) joins us to talk about Unified Comms. We should have been on best behaviour but that doesn't suit us on a Saturday morning! 

This week's news was a mixed bag of Teams news, UC updates, Dev chat and even some Facebook talk.

If you would like to appear on the show, please drop us a line using the form at https://www.greyhatbeard.com/upcoming-shows. We'd love to hear from everyone, especially if you're not an MVP and would like to be heard more in the community.
